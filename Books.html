            To some he was a father,a friend,a nationalist, dedicated to service; to others a ruthless venomous viper,an engima, a shrewed populist politician.Yet in all his givings and misgivings,it is irrefutable even by his adversaries that he was a very passionate and determined man whose shadow left an indelible and relentless mark. Raised as a commoner in the peripheral of Zambia's elusive egalitarian society.He fell in love with the nation but before the nation could fall in love with him,he had traversed a path full of disappointments and setbacks whose pilgrimage makes the frame of this book.His farewell words---'cry for yourself,do not cry for me.' In all his life time, he kept knocking and asking untill even the most unlikely of doors opended and thus enshrined his name in the book of Zambia's political reckonings as one who walked the talk. He will forever be remembered as Zambia's fifth Republican President who rose from the ashes everytime he failed until he conquered.
